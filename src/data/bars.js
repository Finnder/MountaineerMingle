        description: "Boone Saloon was born from a desperate need for a watering-hole that was geared for full grown adults. Sure the college kids would come - we are a college town after all. But, we needed a comfortable, clean place where conversation was revered, quality service and food was appreciated, and style was a heavy consideration. We started with an old white oak tree that we carved out to be the 25 foot, live edge, bar. Then we tore down all the sheetrock and drop ceilings, ripped up the carpet, and let the building show itself. After we built the stage, installed the jukeboxes, added two pool tables, several pinball machines and a full Game Changer Arcade downstairs, and built the Big Deck outside, we were ready to go.",

        description: "Founded in 2018, Ransom Pub brings new meaning to the well-known term 'public house.' Their building, originally home to the Watauga Democrat and soon after Murphy's Irish Pub, is now home to three thriving local businesses: Ransom Pub, serving fresh, local food and wild nightlife; Ransom’s Coffee Shop, serving fair trade, organic coffee; and Wine to Water. As a social enterprise, Ransom gives a portion of annual sales to Wine to Water, supplying support to the organization's round-the-world clean water projects. Through the midst of changes around us, Ransom recognizes the need for in-person connection, and for places with a deep heart for their community. Ransom’s mission is simple: "to love and serve our town by consistently providing exceptional food, uncompromising hospitality, and meaningful community experiences." Ransom not only serves some of Boone's tastiest pub fare, but is also home to King Street's largest event space, hosting weddings, parties, corporate events, karaoke, live music, and anything in between. Come visit us and see how Ransom hopes to welcome all of Boone in one place.",
