    description: "The Local Lion is a family owned and operated business.  Josiah Davis, a Watauga County native, grew up in Boone and is a graduate of Watauga High School. He and his wife, Meredith, are graduates of Appalachian State University. Seeing that Boone was missing a drive-thru coffee shop and doughnut shop, the idea of the Local Lion was born. Josiah and Meredith found doughnut equipment for sale located in Roan Mountain, TN. Little did they know this discovery included the doughnut baking knowledge of  award winning bakers, Tim and Crystal Dekker. Tim and Crystal of Smoky Mountain Bakery, generously trained Josiah and Meredith in the art of making doughnuts from scratch the old fashioned way.",
