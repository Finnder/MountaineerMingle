The cottage underwent significant renovations in the 1950s when it became the residence of the Kepharts, founders of the historic girls camp, Camp Yonahlossee. In 1987, The Gamekeeper Restaurant and Bar was founded. Ken and Wendy purchased The Gamekeeper in 2000 and continue to preserve the historic cottage’s rustic charm and celebrated cooking methods. Since then so many of the loyal clientele and visitors have become dear friends.",
