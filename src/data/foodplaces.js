        description: "An idea to start a bakery. A fun and silly logo with a stick boy on it. A constant search for better products made with better ingredients. A fresh cup of coffee made with organic fair trade beans from a local roaster. A loaf of naturally fermented Carolina Sourdough made with only NC grown organic flour, water and salt. A warm magic cookie or sticky bun. A new café location across town called Stick Boy Kitchen. We have 20 years of history give or take. We could tell a long story about ourselves. We could tell lots of stories. The story that I am most interested in telling though is the story of us. When people come to work at Stick Boy we ask a lot of them. We ask them to work really hard all hours of the day and night, to be creative, to solve problems, and to be honest and challenge each other. We know that work isn’t their first priority though and we don’t want it to be. In the balance of working hard and studying, or leading campus groups, or climbing, or cycling, or raising families or just hanging out with friends, Stick Boy employees manage to squeeze every minute out of a day and somehow do it all again the next day. We have a remarkable team at Stick Boy and we hold each other up and push each other forward every day. Everything you experience when you walk through the doors of Stick Boy is a product of that.",

We do our best to create a fun, safe and rewarding environment where our team members can grow and develop and where we are proud to welcome our guests to Come Back Shack. Our food is so fresh, we don't have freezers.  We serve hand-cut fries from real Idaho potatoes: really hard work for us--really awesome fries for you! Our "regular" burgers aren't so regular. They're made from fresh-never-frozen beef blended by the butcher using chuck, round, and sirloin. Our Local Burger is made from grass-fed beef from a local sustainable family farm, pattied by hand in-house every day. All of our chicken is all-natural, fresh-never-frozen, with no antibiotics. We hand-bread our all-natural chicken tenderloins in breading and marinade we make in-house with no added sugar or MSG. It's mama's recipe! We work hard to use simple ingredients with words you can pronounce. And everyday we make fresh in-house: Come Back Sauce, cole slaw, pickles, ranch dressing, pimento cheese, fried green tomatoes... and more!",
