Although the track is roughly 3.2 miles, it is more complicated than it may initially seem. On this out & back trail hikers will first descend down 1.2 miles to reach Glen Burney Falls, then continue further along to Glen Marie Falls another 0.4 miles down. The return uphill climb is what makes this a tad bit more difficult.",
