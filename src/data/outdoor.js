Many a memory was made and shared in the old Hunt’s Department Store, which is the main part of the Boone location. Its Y-shaped staircase has carried thousands of footsteps upstairs to find overalls and footwear. Today, it’s hard to find the old drain pipes for the sinks in the beauty shop once located inside, but what you will find is eager people ready to help you locate just what you are looking for and to share some helpful hints along the way.",
